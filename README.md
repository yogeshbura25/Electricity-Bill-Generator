# Electricity-Bill-Generator
Description:

This repository contains a program that calculates the electricity bill for a household based on the units of electricity consumed. The program calculates the bill using different price slabs:

For the first 50 units (0-50), the charge is 2 per unit.
For the next 100 units (51-150), the charge is 3 per unit.
For the next 100 units (151-250), the charge is 5 per unit.
For units above 250 (251 and above), the charge is 8 per unit.
Additionally, an extra surcharge of 20% is added to the total amount.
